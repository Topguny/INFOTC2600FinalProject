## INFOTC 2600 Final Project: Hardware Temperatures and Cooling
### Lukas Heading
The goal of this tutorial is to educate people on the maximum operating temperatures of key hardware pieces, optimum temperatures, as well as the different kinds of cooling for standard PC. As well as the types of air pressure used, and then talk about large scale cooling for servers.

### Temperatures:
* The thing to keep in mind is a lot of manufactures have varying reccomended maximum temperatures because all of their hardware is different. 
* High temperatures can reduce electrical efficiancy by raising the eletrical resistance, faster hardware degredation, if you exceed the maxmimum temperature by overiding safeguards you can even potentially melt the low temperature solder.
* Also hardware temperatures are measured in Celcsius so keep that in mind. 
* #### T-Junction Temperature:
* The maximum temperature hardware can reach before it will essentially turn itself off to preserve itself.

### Cooling Types:
#### Air Cooled:

#### Water Cooled:

### Air Pressure for Cooling
#### Positive Air Pressure:
* When you have more air going into your case from fans than out, this will cause air to escape from nooks and crannies preventing more dust from getting in. But in this case you need to make sure your incoming air is filtered or you will add even more dust.

#### Negative Air Pressure:
* When you have more fans pushing air out of the case than in, this causes a negative air pressure. Since the case is lacking intake it will start to innately pull air in through nooks and crannies. This would be fine if these nooks and crannies were filetered but they are not causing more dust to end up in your machine/hardware making it harder to cool and be efficent.

#### Balanced Air Pressure:
* Balanced Air pressure is shown to be the best, but not truelly balanced you want to be slightly on the side of Positive Air Pressure to prevent dust from coming in. Ideally you have 2-3 intake fans that are filtered, and 1-2 exhaust fans that do not need to be filtered.
