## INFOTC 2600 Final Project: Hardware Temperatures and Cooling
### Lukas Heading
The goal of this tutorial is to educate people on the maximum operating temperatures of key hardware pieces, optimum temperatures, as well as the different kinds of cooling for standard PC. As well as the types of air pressure used, and then talk about large scale cooling for servers.

### Temperatures:
* The thing to keep in mind is a lot of manufactures have varying reccomended maximum temperatures because all of their hardware is different. 
* High temperatures can reduce electrical efficiancy by raising the eletrical resistance, faster hardware degredation, if you exceed the maxmimum temperature by overiding safeguards you can even potentially melt the low temperature solder.
* Also hardware temperatures are measured in Celcsius so keep that in mind. 
* #### T-Junction Temperature:
  * The maximum temperature hardware can reach before it will essentially turn itself off to preserve itself.
* The coolest your computer hardware should be is that of the ambient temperature, because if they are cooler they will start to have condensation buildup (hint: water = bad on electrical components).
* Computers under load or while gaming produce a lot more heat than when they are idle.

### Heatsinks:
* Heatsinks sit on top of electrical components that produce heat, they help dicipate the heat off the component to reduce the temperature and keep the component safe.
* Types of Heatsinks:
 * Heat Spreader: flat medal piece that sits on top of components (RAM typically has this)
 * Passive Pinned/Finned Heatsinks: Creates a larger surface area, therefor making heat dicipation greater. (Motherboards use these. CPUs can use these when paired with a fan, but are low grade)

 * Heat Pipe/Vapor Chamber: Copper out layer, with pipes filled with something that switches through phases of liquid and gas as it is heated to provide greater dicipation. (CPUS typically use these, because they are better.)

* Copper is a better heatsink material, than aluminum.
* Heatsinks use thermalpaste when connected to their component it gurantees there are no gaps between the contact points and increases heat transfer.

### Cooling Types:
* Air Cooling is generally cheaper than water cooling, Air coolers of the same price or slightly under can keep components just as cool as Water coolers. But under heavy load or overclocking, water coolers do tend to keep components colder.
#### Air Cooled:
* Uses typically a Heat Pipe/Vapor Chamber as menched above to remove the heat from the component then use fans attached to the pipes to circulate the air to cool the piping down.
#### Water Cooled:
* Uses water or other liquids to cool the components down. It does this by pumping water to the contact plate/heatspreader that touches the component then pushes the water back to the top where it can cool. It then uses a radiator and fans to remove the heat from the water and repeat the process.
 * There is individually water cooled components which is called a closed loop system. Or an Open loop where multiple components are cooled by the same system of water cooling.

### Air Pressure for Cooling
#### Positive Air Pressure:
* When you have more air going into your case from fans than out, this will cause air to escape from nooks and crannies preventing more dust from getting in. But in this case you need to make sure your incoming air is filtered or you will add even more dust.
![Positive](https://github.com/Topguny/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/PositiveAirPressure.PNG)

#### Negative Air Pressure:
* When you have more fans pushing air out of the case than in, this causes a negative air pressure. Since the case is lacking intake it will start to innately pull air in through nooks and crannies. This would be fine if these nooks and crannies were filetered but they are not causing more dust to end up in your machine/hardware making it harder to cool and be efficent.
![Negative](https://github.com/Topguny/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/NegativeAirPressure.PNG)

#### Balanced Air Pressure:
* Balanced Air pressure is shown to be the best, but not truelly balanced you want to be slightly on the side of Positive Air Pressure to prevent dust from coming in. Ideally you have 2-3 intake fans that are filtered, and 1-2 exhaust fans that do not need to be filtered.
